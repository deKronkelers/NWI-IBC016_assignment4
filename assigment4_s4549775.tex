I assume that a committee is like a set meaning that the order does not matter, which is why I use $C$ instead of $P$. $P$ would give a number that is too high because it counts different constellations of the same committee as different committees.

$\sum_{i = 4}^{6}(C(10, 6 - i)C(15, i))\\
= C(10, 2) * C(15, 4) + C(10, 1) * C(15, 5) + C(10, 0) * C(15, 6)\\
= 45 * 1365 + 10 * 3003 + 1 * 5005 = 96460$
